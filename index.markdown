    # Creative Woodwork Crafted for Your Special&nbsp;Space
    
    
    Good to see you here. At WoodConcepts, we carefully craft bespoke woodwork creations from reclaimed New Zealand native timber and other timber from elsewhere.  With innovative craftsmanship, we create beautiful woodwork tailored to suit your unique style and space. We use traditional joinery methods as much as possible.


    Our customers include businesses for example Boho Café in Palmerston North, Curious Little Bagels in Whanganui and Hopper House in Wellington.
